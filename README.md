Thanks a lot!

The following features will not take effect on servers because they are not synced in vanilla Minecraft

- Saturation and exhaustion
- Absorption of living entities

This [plugin](https://github.com/afoxxvi/AsteorBarServer) for Spigot/Paper server can sync saturation and exhaustion to client.
